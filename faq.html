                                Moorer Than A Party Review helped make our big day perfect and magical. During every step of the planning process, she consulted with and supported me when I got flustered or frustrated with all of the makings of putting a wedding together.
                            </p>
                           
                           
                                She was there to shop with me for my wedding dress and to gather gifts for my bridesmaids, and she singlehandedly assembled a DIY backdrop for my wedding to match a photo I fell in love with on Pinterest. She made sure to keep me encouraged throughout the process, and one of her favorite things to say was “If that is what you want, then you’ve got it, that is what we’ll do”. Her priority was the Bride & Groom, and on the day of coordinating, she stopped at nothing to assure the ceremony and reception flowed smoothly. I could never have guessed if there were any hiccups along the way because she took care of them all. I would definitely have Vashanna plan any number of events for me in the future because she is good at event planning and coordinating and does it with joy and the biggest smile.

It was priceless that the anniversary colors coordinated with champagne, chocolates, balloons, and a keepsake box to commemorate the day. The display went above and beyond my expectations. My parents have not stopped talking about the delight it has brought them. I was so happy with this arrangement I had one made for my father's 85th birthday as well. It topped the other Mrs. Moorer went above and beyond for both occasions. I would recommend her to friends and family for upcoming events, holidays, or just a friendly surprise. </p>

                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">My name is Patrice Ward and Moorer Than a Party helped me with my 66th birthday bash at the Signature Grand in Davie, Florida. After having spent a large sum of money on my venue, I was afraid I wouldn’t have enough for balloons I really wanted. Ms. Priscilla my event coordinator called several balloon people and they all started at $800 for a basic balloon package.  I said absolutely not!!  As God would have it someone introduced me to Vashanna, she took the time to listen to me and my concerns as well as my budget constraints.  She created a balloon package that worked for me and was within budget.  She even helped me find additional vendors I needed to include my DJ Music Maestro  </p>

                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">Mrs. Moorer was not only a friend of my wife, but she was a great asset to us and assisted my wife in planning our wedding while I was out of the Country.  She made the process of planning our wedding fun, stress-free, and intimate. I would recommend she and her company plan any event you are considering. Excellent work Mrs. Moorer.

The service received from Mrs. Moorer was exceptional.  She listened to what I needed, but she added a unique surprise for me when I got married...she designed a beautiful centerpiece for our table and also created a message in a vase where the guest could write messages for my husband and I.  Moorer Than a Party is a solid service that provides personal, professional and a unique touch for your special day.  I definitely recommend Mrs. Moorer </p>
